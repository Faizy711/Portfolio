# Purpose
\
This is my personal portfolio meant to show my knowledge and creativity in web development. I use CSS animations for some of my titles. I also use animation gifs made through Adobe Premiere for my contact page *Coming Soon*. I hope this page can show my playfulness with space and moving typography to show a sense of movement on a still page. As my coding skills develope I hope I can incorporate more into my profile page.
